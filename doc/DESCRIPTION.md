Coturn is a [TURN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traversal_Using_Relays_around_NAT) and [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Traversal_Utilities_for_NAT) server. TURN servers enable devices to establish direct peer-to-peer connections, even when they are behind a [NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) and not directly exposed to the Internet. This is especially useful in applications such as audio/video conferencing, where the goal is for media streams to flow directly between participants, rather than routing through a central server.
